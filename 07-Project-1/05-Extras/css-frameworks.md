# CSS Framework Suggestions

There are a multitude of CSS frameworks out there and you can choose to use any them for your first project. Some are better than others in regards to documentation, learning curve, pre-requisite knowledge. This document lists popular CSS frameworks with good documentation and an easy to moderate learning curve.

Bootstrap is an obvious choice, but intentionally left out since the project requirements call for using a framework other than Bootstrap.
