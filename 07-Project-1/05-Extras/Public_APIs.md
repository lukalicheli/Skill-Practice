# List of Free Public APIs

Head over to https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/apis/api-resources for a collective list of
free APIs for use in your projects.

You can also use a searchable table at https://median-man.github.io/public-api-search/.

You should stick with APIs which support CORS and HTTPS.
