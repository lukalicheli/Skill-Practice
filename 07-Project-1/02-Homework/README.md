# 07 Project 1: Interactive Front-End Application <!-- omit in toc -->

At the conclusion of each phase of this course, youâ€™ll work with a group of your fellow students to create a **project**. A project is collaborative work among a group of developers to create an application that solves a real-world problem. Projects model the experience youâ€™ll encounter in every development role at any company, from large multinational businesses to small startups. Coding is collaborative.

A project is a bit different from the Homework assignments youâ€™ve worked on so far. One of the biggest differences is that youâ€™ll no longer build an application by yourself! This has some advantages&mdash;you wonâ€™t have to do all of the work, you can divide up duties, and you can share skills and knowledge with other developers and lean on their strengths. This can also be challenging if youâ€™re used to working alone. Constant communication and time management are just two of the skills youâ€™ll need to practice to make sure everyone in your group works together to complete the project. 

Projects wonâ€™t provide you with a user story or acceptance criteria, because you and your group will create them once you decide which real-world problem your application will solve. This lack of constraints can be freeing in a way, because you have room to build what you want, but it also means that you have to decide what those constraints are before you can start working.

Finally, a project requires a presentation, because youâ€™re trying to convince an audience that it serves a purpose. Your instructional staff and fellow students are investors, and youâ€™re pitching your creation to them&mdash;an experience that developers are required to do frequently. Your presentation is just as important as the actual project, so take it just as seriously.

## Milestones

* Tue, Jan 11: Project proposal
* Fri, Jan 14: Deploy MVP and Prepare for presentations
* Tue, Jan 18: Present and Demo for class

The following breakdown is a recommendation. Depending on the nature of your
app, this schedule may not be ideal for your team. Use this breakdown as a
general guideline for scheduling your project work and tracking progress.

### Project Day 1 <!-- omit in toc -->

* Brainstorm and select concept from a few top ideas. (Focusing on users and
  problems not apps will tend to lead to better ideas.)
* Define and document (use Google Docs) one or more user personas and write user
  stories.
* Setup an empty repo in GitHub. Add collaborators and branch protection rules.
  (see Unit 6 Git activities)
* Setup Kanban board in GitHub.
* Create a written proposal using Google Docs. (See [Proposal Requirements](#proposal-requirements) below.)
* Share the proposal with your instructor: <jdesrosiers@2u.com>. Be sure to
  grant permission to comment.
* Create detailed Mockups/Wireframes. (Pen/Paper, white board, Google Slides,
  [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), [InVision](https://www.invisionapp.com/),
  photoshop, Paint, Photoshop, or other apps are suitable. Add mockup files to
  the repo if the app you are using does not provide shareable access.
* Create issues and add them as cards in the Kanban. All work should be tracked
  by an issue and placed on the Kanban to facilitate clear communication
  throughout the project. (Keep issues small! Issues should never take longer
  than about 4 hours to complete. If someone is working on an issue longer than
  4 hours, there is a problem which needs the entire team's attention. Ask for
  help when you realize you are falling behind when working on an issue.
* Signup for APIs as needed. Make sure at least two people on the team have an
  account with each api.)

### Project Day 2 <!-- omit in toc -->

* Create html for all pages.
* Experiment with APIs and getting some example code working fetching data required in the app.
* First "draft" of responsive layout and styles. Don't worry about perfecting the UI yet.
* Remember to commit often! Each person should make one or more commits **each day**.

### Project Day 3 <!-- omit in toc -->

* Get forms, events, and Server side api calls working.
* Complete majority of core functionality today.
* Focus on functionality and avoid spending too much time working on
  css/styling.
* Remember to commit often! Each person should try to finish a minimum of one
  issue including a pull-request for the issue today.
* Deploy project to GitHub pages and debug as needed.

### Project Day 4 <!-- omit in toc -->

* **Get working MVP deployed in the morning.**
* Outline presentation with entire team.
* Create slide deck.
* Practice presentation.

* **After MVP is Deployed**
  * Find bugs and create issues for them. (Just find them first before fixing anything.)
  * Fix bugs.
  * Polish UI. Now is the time to get the CSS and UI looking amazing.
  * Avoid major changes

### Project Day 5 <!-- omit in toc -->

* There will be a little time in the morning before presentations.
* Practice presentation.
* Handle emergency bugs and problems.
* Presentations will begin immediately after lunch break.
* Submit links to GitHub and deployed URL (Heroku) in BCS.
* Create a professional README for the project
* ðŸŽ‰ Celebrate your accomplishments with your team!

## Proposal Requirements

The proposal should include the following sections:

* Table of Contents
* Team Name
* Working title for the app
* Link to the GitHub repo
* Names of contributors
* One paragraph summary of the concept
* User stories and acceptance criteria
* Breakdown of responsibilities by person (key pages/functions, slide deck,
  readme, team captain, etc. Some people will have multiple responsibilities)
* A rough timeline working backwards from final deployment and presentation on
  the last day with targeted milestones for each day. (Don't worry about who
  will do each thing as that can be hard to estimate beyond the next day.)
* Links to resources and documentation for JavaScript libraries and APIs you
  intend to use.

## Project Requirements

You and your group will use everything youâ€™ve learned over the past six units to create a real-world front-end application that youâ€™ll be able to showcase to potential employers. The user story and acceptance criteria will depend on the project that you create, but your project must fulfil the following requirements:

* Use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap.

* Be deployed to GitHub Pages.

* Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

* Use at least two [server-side APIs](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/apis/api-resources).

* Does not use alerts, confirms, or prompts (use modals).

* Use client-side storage to store persistent data.

* Be responsive.

* Have a polished UI.

* Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).

* Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

## Presentation Requirements

Use this [project presentation template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10QaO9KH8HtUXj__81ve0SZcpO5DbMbqqQr4iPpbwKks/edit?usp=sharing) to address the following:

* Concept: What is your user story? What was your motivation for development?

* Process: What were the technologies used? How were tasks and roles broken down and assigned? What challenges did you encounter? What were your successes?

* Demo: Show your stuff!

* Directions for Future Development

* Links to the deployed application and the GitHub repository
