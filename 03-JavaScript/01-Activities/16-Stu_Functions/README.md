# üèóÔ∏è Write Function to Evaluate Equality of Two Values

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to know when two values are equal to one another.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when the function accepts two parameters. 

* It's done when the message "They are equal in type and value" is logged IF the parameters have the same type and value. (strict equality)

* It's done when the message "They are equal in value" is logged IF the parameters are equal in value but do not have the same type. (lose equality)

* It's done when the message "The values are not equal" is logged IF the values are not equal.

* It's done when the function is called 3 times.

## üí° Hints

How can we use parameters to give a name to the two values that we want to evaluate with the function? 

## üèÜ Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:
