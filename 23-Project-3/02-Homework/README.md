# 23 Final Project: MERN Stack Single-Page Application <!-- omit in toc -->

Projects have played a key role in your journey to becoming a full-stack web developer. As you apply for development jobs, your portfolio is absolutely vital to opening doors to opportunities. Your portfolio showcases high-quality deployed examples of your work, and you can use your finished projects for that very purpose.

This project is a fantastic opportunity to show employers your collaborative skills and coding abilities, especially in the context of a scalable, user-focused MERN app. Remember that employers want to see what you can do, but they also want to see how you work with other developers. The more examples of deployed collaborative work you have in your portfolio, the more likely you are to get an interview and a job.

## Project Requirements

Your group will use everything you’ve learned throughout this course to create a MERN stack single-page application that works with real-world data to solve a real-world challenge, with a focus on data and user demand. This project will provide you with the best opportunity to demonstrate your problem-solving skills, which employers will want to see during interviews. Once again, the user story and acceptance criteria will depend on the project that you create, but your project must fulfill the following requirements:

- Use React for the front end.

- Use _GraphQL API_ with a Node.js and Express.js server.

- Use _MongoDB/Mongoose_ (or _MySQL/Sequelize_) for the data layer.

- Use queries and mutations for retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting data.

- Be deployed using Heroku (with data).

- Have a polished UI.

- Be responsive.

- Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

- Include authentication (_JWT_ or _sessions_).

- Protect sensitive API key information on the server. (environmental variables)

- Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, best practices for class and id naming conventions, indentation, high-quality comments, etc.).

- Have a high-quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

### CSS Styling

Instead of using a CSS library like Bootstrap, consider one of the following suggestions:

- Look into the concept of CSS-in-JS, which abstracts CSS to the component level, using JavaScript to describe styles in a declarative and maintainable way. Some popular libraries include [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) and [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction).

- Try using a component library, such as [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/), [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/), [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/), or [Ant Design](https://ant.design/).

- Create all the CSS for your application using plain CSS and [CSS Modules](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-a-css-modules-stylesheet/).

Ultimately, it doesn't matter which of these options you choose&mdash;it just needs to look professional and be mobile-friendly.

### Payment Platform (Bonus)

Consider integrating the Stripe payment platform. Even if you don’t create an e-commerce application, you could set up your site to accept charitable donations.

### PWA (Bonus)

Although this is not a requirement for your project, see if you can also implement functionality to meet the minimum requirements of a PWA:

- Uses a web manifest

- Uses a service worker for offline functionality

- Is installable

## Presentation Requirements

Use this [project presentation template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10QaO9KH8HtUXj__81ve0SZcpO5DbMbqqQr4iPpbwKks/edit?usp=sharing) to address the following:

- Elevator pitch: a one minute description of your application

- Concept: What is your user story? What was your motivation for development?

- Process: What were the technologies used? How were tasks and roles broken down and assigned? What challenges did you encounter? What were your successes?

- Demo: Show your stuff!

- Directions for Future Development

- Links to the deployed application and the GitHub repository. Use the [Guide to Deploy with Heroku and MongoDB Atlas](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/mongodb/deploy-with-heroku-and-mongodb-atlas) on The Full-Stack Blog if you need a reminder on how to deploy to Heroku.

## How to Submit Your MERN Stack Single-Page Application

**Each member of your group** is required to submit the following for review:

- The URL of the deployed application.

- The URL of the GitHub repository, with a unique name and a README describing the project.

## Proposal Requirements

Use [this template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NPrUgDdgsJ9dd6BVqX0I31h-bWmx5N6-oAzXpHwv-VA/edit?usp=sharing) for planning your project.

The proposal should include the following sections:

- Table of Contents
- Team Name
- Working title for the app
- Link to the GitHub repo
- Names of contributors
- One paragraph summary of the concept
- User stories and Acceptance criteria
- Breakdown of responsibilities by person (front-end, back-end, slide deck readme, team captain, etc. Some people will have multiple responsibilities)
- A rough timeline working backwards from final deployment and presentation on the last day with targeted milestones for each day. (Don't worry about who will do each thing as that can be hard to estimate beyond the next day.)
- Links to resources and documentation for packages and APIs you intend to use.

## Milestones

<!-- TODO: add dates for key milestones (see https://ucsd.bootcampcontent.com/UCSD-Coding-Bootcamp/UCSD-SD-VIRT-FSF-FT-12-2021-U-C/-/blob/main/15-Project-2/02-Homework/README.md#L157-159) -->
- Thu, Mar. 10: Project Proposal
- Tue, Mar. 15: MVP Deployed
- Wed, Mar. 16: Present Project and Demo for Class

The following breakdown is a recommendation. Depending on the nature of your
app, this schedule may not be ideal for your team. Use this breakdown as a
general guideline for scheduling your project work and tracking progress.

### Pre-work (Day 0) <!-- omit in toc -->

Before the beginning of the project, start working with your team on the following. Aim to complete these during the week preceding the project.

- Brainstorm and select concept from a few top ideas. (Focusing on users and
  problems not features will tend to lead to better ideas.)
- Define and document (use Google Docs) one or more [user personas and write user stories](https://www.justinmind.com/blog/user-personas-scenarios-user-stories-and-storyboards-whats-the-difference/).

### Project Day 1 <!-- omit in toc -->

- Quickly decide on a name for your team.
- Choose a working title for the app.
- Setup an empty repo or use template repo on GitHub. Add collaborators and branch protection rules.
- Setup Kanban board in GitHub.
- Create a written proposal using Google Docs. (See [Proposal Requirements](#proposal-requirements) below.)
- Share the proposal with your instructor: <jdesrosiers@2u.com>. _Be sure to
  grant permission to comment._
- Create detailed Mockups/Wireframes. (Pen/Paper, white board, Google Slides, [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), [InVision](https://www.invisionapp.com/), Paint, Photoshop, or other apps are suitable. Add mockup files to the repo if the app you are using does not provide shareable access.
- **Recommended:** With the entire team present, create a diagram (tree) of the React components you will use to build the front-end. You will need the wireframes done before creating the diagram. Read [Thinking in React](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html) for a better understanding of why this activity is so beneficial for a team. Annotate the diagram with notes about state and how it will be updated.
- Create a diagram or set of tables depicting models including fields, types, validation rules, and relationships.
- Create a list of GraphQL queries and mutations that are required for the app.
- Create issues and add them as cards in the Kanban. All work should be tracked by an issue and placed on the Kanban to facilitate clear communication throughout the project. Keep issues small! Issues should never take longer than no more than 4 hours to complete. If someone is working on an issue longer than 4 hours then there is a problem that should get the entire team's attention. Ask for help when you realize you are falling behind when working on an issue.
- Signup for APIs as needed. Make sure at least two people on the team have an
  account with each api.)

### Project Day 2 + weekend <!-- omit in toc -->

- Remember to commit often! Each person should make one or more commits **each day**.

#### Front End

- Complete client side routing and major components without any state. Use placeholder/fake data to avoid needing any connection with the backend. Don't worry about getting CSS perfect. Polishing the UI comes later. Focus on function, not style.
- Add state and queries/mutations to the client to support user login/signup.

#### Back End

- Define all models.
- Create a seeder script if deemed necessary.
- Create mutations/queries to support authentication and use GraphQL playground to test. (Create auth api routes if not using GraphQL and use Insomnia to test.)

### Project Day 3 <!-- omit in toc -->

- Have majority of your functionality implemented by the end of the day.
- Remember to commit often! Each person should try to finish a at least one
  issue including a pull-request for the issue today.
- Add state and integrate with backend using apollo client.
- Create mutation/queries for integration with the client layer.
- Initial deployment to Heroku including database setup.

### Project Day 4 + Weekend <!-- omit in toc -->

- **Working MVP deployed in the morning.**
- Outline presentation with entire team.
- Create slide deck.
- Practice presentation.
- Create professional README.

- **After MVP is Deployed**
  - Find bugs and create issues for them. (Just find them first before fixing anything.)
  - Fix bugs.
  - Polish UI.
  - Avoid major changes

### Project Day 5 <!-- omit in toc -->

- Presentation/Demos will be at the **beginning** of class. (There will not be any time for working on project on day 5.)
- Submit links to GitHub and deployed URL (Heroku) in BCS.
- 🎉 Celebrate your accomplishments with your team!
