# README Guide

A well done "README" file is an important communication tool used by developers to provide information about a project in a readable format.

Each project you work on in this course should include a README fil which describe why you built the project, what problem the project solves, and what you learned during the process.

Open the [Professional README Guide](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/github/professional-readme-guide) to learn about the types of information to include and a README. You can also use the example as a template for getting started on your own README files. You'll want to add this guide to your bookmarks in your browser and refer back to it often throughout this course and the rest of your career.
